  <div class="style=display: flex;"> <h3><p style="display:inline-block";>One of the ripple effects of the stifling competition for education institutes is the growing necessity for schools to enhance their mechanisms for better serving applicantâ€™s. This is where enrollment systems come into play, simplifying and accelerating student enrollment.

    In simpler words, an enrollment system combines all activities 
    involved in the entire enrollment process and integrates them into a system. 
    This way, everything happens in one place, both online and offline.The conversation happened with the prospects, the pages they are visiting, their interests and motivations, their personal details, the meetings scheduled with them to name a few. The overall objective of an 
    enrollment system is to help admission teams ultimately enroll more students.</p></h3></div>
